                  <p class="my-4">"I recently got my hands on Flowbite Pro, and holy crap, I'm speechless with how easy this was to integrate within my application. Most templates are a pain, code is scattered, and near impossible to theme.</p>
                  <p class="my-4">Flowbite has code in one place and I'm not joking when I say it took me a matter of minutes to copy the code, customise it and integrate within a Laravel + Vue application.</p>
                  <p class="my-4">If you care for your time, I hands down would go with this."</p>
